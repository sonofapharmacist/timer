terminal timer designed to get/keep my butt in a seat for 25 minutes and remind me to get my butt out of the seat after time expires.

timer.py is for windows 11.  you will need pip to install win11toast for this to work

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

timerOSX.py and its .sh can be run to pop the terminal and will run as expected.
